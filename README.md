# splitea

Is a tool to split images. The code is based on [image-splitter](https://github.com/achimoraites/image-splitter) code.

The idea is that you tell to the lib what image and:

- N images per row and M images per colum -> You get image splitted into N x M images.
- N px per row and M px per colum -> You get image splitted into images with N x M px.
